// * We are given a labyrinth of size N x N. Some of its 
//cells are empty (0) and some are full (x). We can 
//move from an empty cell to another empty cell if 
//they share common wall. Given a starting position 
//(*) calculate and fill in the array the minimal 
//distance from this position to any other cell in the 
//array. Use "u" for all unreachable cells.
