Improvements:

1. If you create nonclustered index in Toys table on Type and Price columns, that would speed up the searchign for the first query in Problem 3 dramatically.

2. If you create nonclustered index in Toys table on AgeRange including Manufacturer, that would boost the search performance to great extend.

3. If you create nonclustered index in ToysCategory on CategoryID including ToyId, the performance of the searching will be much faster.
