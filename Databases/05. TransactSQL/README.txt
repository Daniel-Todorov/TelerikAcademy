GENERAL:

- I have detached the database BankAccounts from Problem 1. It contains several records. Please, attach it before continuing.

- I have also detached the TelerikAcademy DB. Please attach it before continuing.

- All queries are saved separately. Double click should let you execute them in SSMS. 

- NOTE that you need to have the database attached in order to have the queries working.
