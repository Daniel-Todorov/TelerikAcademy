Hey, please, take in mind the following note:


1. I am using MS SQL Server, not the express version. Please, change all connection strings to correspond with your SQL server version.

2. To access the the services frm WCF, please, run the WCF project on IIS and then use the links I have posted in the Interface.

3. I have removed all packages and enabled their restoration. Still, take in mind some may be missing. Please, install them manually.

4. I haven't done any  unit tests, so you can skip that part.


Thank you for spending your time to review my exam!
