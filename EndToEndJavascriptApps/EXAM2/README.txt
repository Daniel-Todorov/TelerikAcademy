Greetings and thank you for evaluating my exam!
I hope this summary of what I have NOT done will save you some time. Feel free to skip any queston regarding the following:

1. I don't have server side paging anywhere.
2. User can't join an event
3. User can't leave an event
4. User can't leave comments
5. User can't change profile image
6. User can't add phone number


As for the other features, I beleive I'd done them to a good extend. I've used one of Ivaylo's skeletons from the exam preparation so I believe the architecture of the app is fine.



Good luck and hope you've done better!
