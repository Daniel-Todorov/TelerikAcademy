Hi there!
Please, make sure you run the scrip WorldWideInfo-DB and Seed.sql to create the db for the first problems. The forth problem has code first with automatic migrations.

NOTE! I use the regular vertion of MSSQL Server. Please, ajust the conenction strings if you use the Express version.

Thank you for the time spend for evaluating my homework! Good luck!
