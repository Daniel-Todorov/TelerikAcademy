Hey!
Thank you for evaluating my exam! Please, take in mind the following notes:

1. The connection string points to . //SQL server is used, not SQLEXPRESS or localDB

2. When checking for the validation error messages, please, be careful coz sometimes they are not so visible. They are supposed to pop up around the text box which has the error.

Thank you again and good luck!
